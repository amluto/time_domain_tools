To build:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
python setup.py build_ext --in-place # Or your favorite set of options.

If you are on something like RHEL5, try:
./configure CC=gcc44 CXX=g++44
That might give you a new enough gcc to use SSE4, which will speed up
data format conversion a lot.

The build system is gross.  Improvements are welcome.
